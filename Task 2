# Task 3: Securing Your Own Wi-Fi Network

## Overview

This repository documents the process of conducting a **Wi-Fi security assessment** on my home network as part of Task 3 in the **Future Interns** program. The goal of this task was to identify vulnerabilities in my Wi-Fi network and implement security measures to protect it from potential threats. 

The assessment included checking for weak passwords, scanning for open ports, identifying unauthorized devices, and capturing network traffic to analyze potential vulnerabilities.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Password Strength Check**
- Ensured that the Wi-Fi password was strong and secure by following best practices for creating complex passwords.
- The Wi-Fi password was changed to a secure one, consisting of a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

### 2. **Nmap Scan for Open Ports**
- Performed a thorough **Nmap scan** on my home network to identify all IP addresses and open ports across the subnet.
- This scan provided insight into which ports were open and if any unnecessary services were running on the router or connected devices.

### 3. **Packet Capture Using Wireshark**
- Captured network traffic with **Wireshark** to monitor the flow of data packets on my Wi-Fi network.
- Analyzed the captured packets to identify any potential data leaks or vulnerabilities.
- Investigated the types of traffic flowing in and out of the network to assess whether any sensitive information was exposed.

### 4. **Identifying Unauthorized Devices**
- Checked the list of devices connected to my network via the routerâ€™s **device management page**.
- Identified any unauthorized devices connected to the network and took the necessary steps to block or remove them.
- The Wi-Fi password was changed to disconnect unauthorized devices and prevent future intrusions.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer to capture and inspect data packets on the Wi-Fi network.
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool to identify open ports, IP addresses, and services running on the network.
- **Router Admin Interface**: Used to view connected devices and manage security settings.

## Key Learnings
- **Network Security Fundamentals**: Gained a solid understanding of how to secure Wi-Fi networks against common threats.
- **Wi-Fi Encryption**: Ensured that my network used **WPA3** encryption for stronger security.
- **Penetration Testing**: Learned how to scan networks for open ports, capture packets, and identify unauthorized devices.
- **Security Best Practices**: Developed a set of best practices for securing home networks, including regularly changing passwords, disabling unnecessary services, and using encryption.

## Recommendations
- Always use **WPA3** encryption for better protection against attacks.
- Regularly change your Wi-Fi password and ensure it is strong and unique.
- Disable unnecessary open ports and services on your router.
- Monitor connected devices and block unauthorized ones immediately.
- Keep your router's firmware up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Through this task, I have learned valuable skills related to **network security** and **penetration testing**. By analyzing and securing my home Wi-Fi network, I have gained insights into how attackers might exploit weak spots in a network and how to effectively mitigate those risks. I look forward to continuing to build on this knowledge and applying it in real-world scenarios.
